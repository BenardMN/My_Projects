	<p>Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought on this continet, a ew nation,conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
		<br/>
	Now we are engagedin a civil war, testong whether that nation, or any nation so coneived and so dedicated can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives so that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.</p>
